## Mockup

Wireframe link: https://tinyurl.com/eternalwireframe

There are two main parts to the wireframe. The first is the social media part consisting of the following three pages: the main feed page, the level page, and the user profile page. Then, there is the game part, which is launched from any of the social-media-related pages by clicking on the "Launch Game" button on the navigation bar. The game consists of four sections (likely would be combined as interactive parts of a single page). The first section gives users the choice between playing the provided levels or launching the level creator. The second section allows the user to choose a difficulty from the provided levels to play. The third section is the game itself (playing a provided level, level creator level, or other user's level). The fourth is the level creator.
